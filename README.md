# Robin Tracker
Thanks to everyone who used and supported the leaderboard over the last week. It's been a fun ride!

## Want data for visualizations?
The tier and pedigree information is already available here: https://monstrouspeace.com/robintracker/dump/pedigree.json

I will be creating and uploading a MySQL dump tomorrow (check back)!

Do you want other information? File an issue letting me know what specific data you're interested in!
